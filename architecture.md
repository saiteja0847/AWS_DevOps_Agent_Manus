# AWS DevOps Agent Architecture

## Overview
The AWS DevOps Agent is designed to understand natural language prompts from users and translate them into AWS infrastructure operations. The agent leverages large language models to parse user requirements, extract relevant parameters, and execute the appropriate AWS API calls with proper validation and confirmation steps.

## Core Components

### 1. Main Controller
- **Purpose**: Central entry point that routes user prompts to appropriate service agents
- **Functionality**:
  - Analyzes user input to determine intent (create, modify, delete, etc.)
  - Identifies AWS service(s) mentioned in the prompt
  - Routes to appropriate service agent
  - Handles multi-service operations
  - Manages conversation context and history

### 2. Service Router
- **Purpose**: Determines which AWS service agent should handle the request
- **Functionality**:
  - Uses NLP to identify service mentions (EC2, S3, RDS, etc.)
  - Handles ambiguous requests by asking for clarification
  - Supports multi-service operations by coordinating between agents
  - Maintains operation sequence for dependent services

### 3. Prompt Understanding System
- **Purpose**: Extracts parameters, configurations, and intentions from user prompts
- **Functionality**:
  - Identifies operation type (create, start, stop, etc.)
  - Extracts service-specific parameters
  - Recognizes business requirements and translates to technical specifications
  - Handles ambiguity through clarification requests
  - Maintains conversation context for follow-up requests

### 4. Service Agents
- **Purpose**: Service-specific modules that handle operations for particular AWS services
- **Structure** (for each service):
  - **Agent**: Orchestrates the operation workflow for the service
  - **Parser**: Extracts service-specific parameters from the prompt
  - **Tools**: Implements the actual AWS API calls
  - **Schema**: Defines the parameter structure for the service
  - **Validator**: Ensures parameters are valid and configurations are secure

### 5. Configuration Validator
- **Purpose**: Validates configurations before execution
- **Functionality**:
  - Checks for security best practices
  - Validates parameter combinations
  - Estimates costs
  - Identifies potential issues or inefficiencies
  - Suggests optimizations

### 6. Execution Engine
- **Purpose**: Executes AWS operations with proper error handling
- **Functionality**:
  - Manages AWS credentials
  - Executes API calls
  - Handles rate limiting and retries
  - Provides operation status updates
  - Implements rollback mechanisms for failed operations

### 7. Infrastructure as Code Generator
- **Purpose**: Generates IaC templates from configurations
- **Functionality**:
  - Creates CloudFormation/Terraform templates
  - Supports importing existing infrastructure
  - Allows for template customization
  - Provides version control integration

## Data Flow

1. **User Input** → **Main Controller**
   - User provides natural language prompt
   - Controller analyzes intent and service requirements

2. **Main Controller** → **Service Router**
   - Router identifies relevant AWS services
   - Routes to appropriate service agent(s)

3. **Service Router** → **Prompt Understanding System**
   - System extracts parameters and configurations
   - Translates business requirements to technical specifications

4. **Prompt Understanding System** → **Service Agent**
   - Agent receives parsed parameters
   - Orchestrates operation workflow

5. **Service Agent** → **Configuration Validator**
   - Validator checks configuration
   - Provides feedback on issues or optimizations

6. **Configuration Validator** → **User Confirmation**
   - User reviews configuration
   - Approves or modifies before execution

7. **User Confirmation** → **Execution Engine**
   - Engine executes AWS operations
   - Provides status updates

8. **Execution Engine** → **User Feedback**
   - User receives operation results
   - Gets links to created resources

## Extension Points

### Additional AWS Services
- Each new service requires:
  - Service-specific agent
  - Custom parser for service parameters
  - Service-specific tools for API calls
  - JSON schema for parameter validation

### Business Requirements Translation
- Enhanced NLP capabilities to:
  - Understand high-level business needs
  - Suggest appropriate infrastructure
  - Optimize for cost, performance, security, etc.

### Infrastructure Management
- Support for:
  - Infrastructure monitoring
  - Cost optimization
  - Compliance checking
  - Performance tuning

## Security Considerations

1. **Credential Management**
   - Secure storage of AWS credentials
   - Support for IAM roles and temporary credentials
   - Principle of least privilege for operations

2. **Operation Validation**
   - Security checks before execution
   - Prevention of insecure configurations
   - Compliance with organizational policies

3. **Audit and Logging**
   - Comprehensive logging of all operations
   - Audit trail for infrastructure changes
   - Integration with AWS CloudTrail

## Implementation Approach

1. **Phase 1: Core Framework**
   - Implement main controller and service router
   - Enhance existing EC2 agent
   - Develop configuration validator

2. **Phase 2: Service Expansion**
   - Add support for S3, VPC, RDS, Lambda
   - Implement service-specific agents and parsers
   - Create cross-service operation capabilities

3. **Phase 3: Advanced Features**
   - Develop business requirements translation
   - Implement IaC generator
   - Add cost optimization and security enhancements

4. **Phase 4: User Experience**
   - Improve conversation flow
   - Add visualization capabilities
   - Implement feedback mechanisms
